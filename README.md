## Week 1: April 1st–April 7th
###  [Single Number](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week1-singleNumber.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week1-singleNumber_test.go)
```
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
Example 1:
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

###  [Happy Number](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week1-happyNumber.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week1-happyNumber_test.go)
```
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy".
A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.
Example:
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

###  [Maximum Subarray](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week1-maximumSubarray.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week1-maximumSubarray_test.go)
```
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
Example:
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
Follow up:
If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

```

###  [Move Zeroes](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week1-moveZeroes.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week1-moveZeroes_test.go)
```
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Example:
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Note:
You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.
   Hide Hint #1
In-place means we should not be allocating any space for extra array. But we are allowed to modify the existing array. However, as a first step, try coming up with a solution that makes use of additional space. For this problem as well, first apply the idea discussed using an additional array and the in-place solution will pop up eventually.
   Hide Hint #2
A two-pointer approach could be helpful here. The idea would be to have one pointer for iterating the array and another pointer that just works on the non-zero elements of the array.
```

###  [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week1-bestTimetoBuyandSellStockII.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week1-bestTimetoBuyandSellStockII_test.go)
```
Say you have an array prices for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
Example 1:
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
Example 3:
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
Constraints:
1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 4
0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4
```

###  [Group Anagrams](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week1-groupAnagrams.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week1-groupAnagrams_test.go)
```
Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.
Example:
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
Output:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
Note:
All inputs will be in lowercase.
The order of your output does not matter.
```

###  [Counting Elements](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week1-countingElements.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week1-countingElements_test.go)
```
Given an integer array arr, count element x such that x + 1 is also in arr.
If there're duplicates in arr, count them seperately.
Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.
Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7]
Output: 0
Explanation: No numbers are counted, cause there's no 2, 4, 6, or 8 in arr.
Example 3:
Input: arr = [1,3,2,3,5,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: 0, 1 and 2 are counted cause 1, 2 and 3 are in arr.
Example 4:
Input: arr = [1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: Two 1s are counted cause 2 is in arr.
Constraints:
1 <= arr.length <= 1000
0 <= arr[i] <= 1000
```


## Week 2: Week 2: April 8th–April 14th
###  [Middle of the Linked List](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week2-middleoftheLinkedList.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week2-middleoftheLinkedList_test.go)
```
Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node of linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
The returned node has value 3.  (The judge's serialization of this node is [3,4,5]).
Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next = NULL.
Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: Node 4 from this list (Serialization: [4,5,6])
Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
Note:
The number of nodes in the given list will be between 1 and 100.
```

###  [Backspace String Compare](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week2-backspaceStringCompare.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week2-backspaceStringCompare_test.go)
```
Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.
Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.
Example 1:
Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
Example 2:
Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".
Example 3:
Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "c".
Example 4:
Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".
Note:
1 <= S.length <= 200
1 <= T.length <= 200
S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.
Follow up:
Can you solve it in O(N) time and O(1) space?
```

###  [Min Stack](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week2-minStack.go)
```
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
top() -- Get the top element.
getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.
Example 1:
Input
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]
Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2
Constraints:
Methods pop, top and getMin operations will always be called on non-empty stacks.
   Hide Hint #1  
Consider each node in the stack having a minimum value. (Credits to @aakarshmadhavan)

###  [Diameter of Binary Tree](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week2-diameterofBinaryTree.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week2-diameterofBinaryTree_test.go)
```
Diameter of Binary Tree
Solution
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
Example:
Given a binary tree
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \
      4   5
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
```

###  [Last Stone Weight](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week2-lastStoneWeight.go)
```
We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.
Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:
If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)
Example 1:
Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.
Note:
1 <= stones.length <= 30
1 <= stones[i] <= 1000
   Hide Hint #1
Simulate the process. We can do it with a heap, or by sorting some list of stones every time we take a turn.
```

###  [Contiguous Array](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week2-contiguousArray.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week2-contiguousArray_test.go)
```
Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
Example 1:
Input: [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
Example 2:
Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
Note: The length of the given binary array will not exceed 50,000.
```

###  [Perform String Shifts](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week2-performStringShifts.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week2-performStringShifts_test.go)
```
You are given a string s containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix shift, where shift[i] = [direction, amount]:
direction can be 0 (for left shift) or 1 (for right shift).
amount is the amount by which string s is to be shifted.
A left shift by 1 means remove the first character of s and append it to the end.
Similarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of s and add it to the beginning.
Return the final string after all operations.
Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", shift = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: "cab"
Explanation:
[0,1] means shift to left by 1. "abc" -> "bca"
[1,2] means shift to right by 2. "bca" -> "cab"
Example 2:
Input: s = "abcdefg", shift = [[1,1],[1,1],[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: "efgabcd"
Explanation:
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "abcdefg" -> "gabcdef"
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "gabcdef" -> "fgabcde"
[0,2] means shift to left by 2. "fgabcde" -> "abcdefg"
[1,3] means shift to right by 3. "abcdefg" -> "efgabcd"
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 100
s only contains lower case English letters.
1 <= shift.length <= 100
shift[i].length == 2
0 <= shift[i][0] <= 1
0 <= shift[i][1] <= 100
   Hide Hint #1
Intuitively performing all shift operations is acceptable due to the constraints.
   Hide Hint #2
You may notice that left shift cancels the right shift, so count the total left shift times (may be negative if the final result is right shift), and perform it once.

```

## Week 3: Week 3: April 15th–April 21st
###  [Leftmost Column with at Least a One](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week3-leftmostColumnwithatLeastaOne.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week3-leftmostColumnwithatLeastaOne_test.go)
```
(This problem is an interactive problem.)
A binary matrix means that all elements are 0 or 1. For each individual row of the matrix, this row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Given a row-sorted binary matrix binaryMatrix, return leftmost column index(0-indexed) with at least a 1 in it. If such index doesn't exist, return -1.
You can't access the Binary Matrix directly.  You may only access the matrix using a BinaryMatrix interface:
BinaryMatrix.get(x, y) returns the element of the matrix at index (x, y) (0-indexed).
BinaryMatrix.dimensions() returns a list of 2 elements [n, m], which means the matrix is n * m.
Submissions making more than 1000 calls to BinaryMatrix.get will be judged Wrong Answer.  Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.
For custom testing purposes you're given the binary matrix mat as input in the following four examples. You will not have access the binary matrix directly.
Example 1:
Input: mat = [[0,0],[1,1]]
Output: 0
Example 2:
Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: 1
Example 3:
Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,0]]
Output: -1
Example 4:
Input: mat = [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,1,1],[0,1,1,1]]
Output: 1
Constraints:
1 <= mat.length, mat[i].length <= 100
mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
mat[i] is sorted in a non-decreasing way.
   Hide Hint #1
1. (Binary Search) For each row do a binary search to find the leftmost one on that row and update the answer.
   Hide Hint #2
2. (Optimal Approach) Imagine there is a pointer p(x, y) starting from top right corner. p can only move left or down. If the value at p is 0, move down. If the value at p is 1, move left. Try to figure out the correctness and time complexity of this algorithm.
```

###  [Valid Parenthesis String](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week3-validParenthesisString.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week3-validParenthesisString_test.go)
```
Given a string containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*', write a function to check whether this string is valid. We define the validity of a string by these rules:
Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
'*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string.
An empty string is also valid.
Example 1:
Input: "()"
Output: True
Example 2:
Input: "(*)"
Output: True
Example 3:
Input: "(*))"
Output: True
Note:
The string size will be in the range [1, 100].
```

###  [Number of Islands](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week3-numberofIslands.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week3-numberofIslands_test.go)
```
Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
Example 1:
Input:
11110
11010
11000
00000
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input:
11000
11000
00100
00011
Output: 3
```

###  [Minimum Path Sum](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week3-minimumPathSum.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week3-minimumPathSum_test.go)
```
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.
Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
Example:
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```

###  [Searchin Rotated Sorted Array](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week3-searchinRotatedSortedArray.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week3-searchinRotatedSortedArray_test.go)
```
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

###  [Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week3-constructBinarySearchTreefromPreorderTraversal.go)
```
Return the node node of a binary search tree that matches the given preorder traversal.
(Recall that a binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of node.left has a value < node.val, and any descendant of node.right has a value > node.val.  Also recall that a preorder traversal displays the value of the node first, then traverses node.left, then traverses node.right.)
Example 1:
Input: [8,5,1,7,10,12]
Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]
     8
    / \
   5   10
  / \    \
 1   7    12
Note:
1 <= preorder.length <= 100
The values of preorder are distinct.
```

## Week 4: April 22nd–April 28th
###  [Subarray Sum Equals K](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week4-subarraySumEqualsK.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week4-subarraySumEqualsK_test.go)
```
Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.
Example 1:
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Note:
The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].
   Hide Hint #1  
Will Brute force work here? Try to optimize it.
   Hide Hint #2  
Can we optimize it by using some extra space?
   Hide Hint #3  
What about storing sum frequencies in a hash table? Will it be useful?
   Hide Hint #4  
sum(i,j)=sum(0,j)-sum(0,i), where sum(i,j) represents the sum of all the elements from index i to j-1. Can we use this property to optimize it.

###  [Product of Array Except Self](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week3-productofArrayExceptSelf.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week3-productofArrayExceptSelf_test.go)
```
Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
Example:
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.
Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).
Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

```

###  [Subarray Sum Equals K](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week4-bitwiseANDofNumbersRange.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week4-bitwiseANDofNumbersRange_test.go)
```
Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.
Example 1:
Input: [5,7]
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: [0,1]
Output: 0
```

###  [LRU Cache](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week4-LRU_Cache.go)
```
Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and put.
get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.
The cache is initialized with a positive capacity.
Follow up:
Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?
Example:
LRUCache cache = new LRUCache( 2 /* capacity */ );
cache.put(1, 1);
cache.put(2, 2);
cache.get(1);       // returns 1
cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1
cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.get(3);       // returns 3
cache.get(4);       // returns 4
```
ex:
```
cache := Constructor(2 /* capacity */)
cache.Put(1, 1)
cache.Put(2, 2)
fmt.Println(cache.Get(1)) // returns 1
cache.Put(3, 3)           // evicts key 2

###  [Jump Game](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week4-jumpGame.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week4-jumpGame_test.go)
```
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
Determine if you are able to reach the last index.
Example 1:
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
Example 2:
Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum
             jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```

###  [Longest Common Subsequence](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week4-longestCommonSubsequence.go) [(Test Case)](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week4-longestCommonSubsequence_test.go)
```
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
Example 1:
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
Example 2:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
Example 3:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
Constraints:
1 <= text1.length <= 1000
1 <= text2.length <= 1000
The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.
   Hide Hint #1
Try dynamic programming. DP[i][j] represents the longest common subsequence of text1[0 ... i] & text2[0 ... j].
   Hide Hint #2
DP[i][j] = DP[i - 1][j - 1] + 1 , if text1[i] == text2[j] DP[i][j] = max(DP[i - 1][j], DP[i][j - 1]) , otherwise

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0
Output: 4

###  [Maximal Square](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week4-maximalSquare.go)
```
You have a queue of integers, you need to retrieve the first unique integer in the queue.
Implement the FirstUnique class:
FirstUnique(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the numbers in the queue.
int showFirstUnique() returns the value of the first unique integer of the queue, and returns -1 if there is no such integer.
void add(int value) insert value to the queue.
Example 1:
Input:
["FirstUnique","showFirstUnique","add","showFirstUnique","add","showFirstUnique","add","showFirstUnique"]
[[[2,3,5]],[],[5],[],[2],[],[3],[]]
Output:
[null,2,null,2,null,3,null,-1]
Explanation:
FirstUnique firstUnique = new FirstUnique([2,3,5]);
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return 2
firstUnique.add(5);            // the queue is now [2,3,5,5]
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return 2
firstUnique.add(2);            // the queue is now [2,3,5,5,2]
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return 3
firstUnique.add(3);            // the queue is now [2,3,5,5,2,3]
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return -1
Example 2:
Input:
["FirstUnique","showFirstUnique","add","add","add","add","add","showFirstUnique"]
[[[7,7,7,7,7,7]],[],[7],[3],[3],[7],[17],[]]
Output:
[null,-1,null,null,null,null,null,17]
Explanation:
FirstUnique firstUnique = new FirstUnique([7,7,7,7,7,7]);
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return -1
firstUnique.add(7);            // the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
firstUnique.add(3);            // the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3]
firstUnique.add(3);            // the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3]
firstUnique.add(7);            // the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,7]
firstUnique.add(17);           // the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,7,17]
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return 17
Example 3:
Input:
["FirstUnique","showFirstUnique","add","showFirstUnique"]
[[[809]],[],[809],[]]
Output:
[null,809,null,-1]
Explanation:
FirstUnique firstUnique = new FirstUnique([809]);
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return 809
firstUnique.add(809);          // the queue is now [809,809]
firstUnique.showFirstUnique(); // return -1
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^8
1 <= value <= 10^8
At most 50000 calls will be made to showFirstUnique and add.
   Hide Hint #1
Use doubly Linked list with hashmap of pointers to linked list nodes. add unique number to the linked list. When add is called check if the added number is unique then it have to be added to the linked list and if it is repeated remove it from the linked list if exists. When showFirstUnique is called retrieve the head of the linked list.
   Hide Hint #2
Use queue and check that first element of the queue is always unique.
   Hide Hint #3
Use set or heap to make running time of each function O(logn).
```
example:
```
	firstUnique := FirstUnique_Constructor([]int{2, 3, 5})
	firstUnique.prt()
	firstUnique.ShowFirstUnique() // return -1
	firstUnique.Add(5)            // the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
	firstUnique.prt()
	firstUnique.Add(2) // the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3]
	firstUnique.prt()
	firstUnique.Add(3) // the queue is now [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3]
	firstUnique.prt()
	firstUnique.ShowFirstUnique() // return 17

###  [Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week5-binaryTreeMaximumPathSum.go)
```
Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3]
       1
      / \
     2   3
Output: 6
Example 2:
Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
   -10
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Output: 42
```

###  [Check If a String Is a Valid Sequence from Root to Leaves Path in a Binary Tree](https://github.com/eehsiao/30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge/blob/master/week5-checkIfaStringIsaValidSequencefromRoottoLeavesPathinaBinaryTree.go)
```
Given a binary tree where each path going from the root to any leaf form a valid sequence, check if a given string is a valid sequence in such binary tree.
We get the given string from the concatenation of an array of integers arr and the concatenation of all values of the nodes along a path results in a sequence in the given binary tree.
Example 1:
Input: root = [0,1,0,0,1,0,null,null,1,0,0], arr = [0,1,0,1]
Output: true
Explanation:
The path 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 is a valid sequence (green color in the figure).
Other valid sequences are:
0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0
0 -> 0 -> 0
Example 2:
Input: root = [0,1,0,0,1,0,null,null,1,0,0], arr = [0,0,1]
Output: false
Explanation: The path 0 -> 0 -> 1 does not exist, therefore it is not even a sequence.
Example 3:
Input: root = [0,1,0,0,1,0,null,null,1,0,0], arr = [0,1,1]
Output: false
Explanation: The path 0 -> 1 -> 1 is a sequence, but it is not a valid sequence.
Constraints:
1 <= arr.length <= 5000
0 <= arr[i] <= 9
Each node's value is between [0 - 9].
   Hide Hint #1
Depth-first search (DFS) with the parameters: current node in the binary tree and current position in the array of integers.
   Hide Hint #2
When reaching at final position check if it is a leaf node.
